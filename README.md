# NextJS/ReactJS Design Internship Assignment


In this project, I developed a responsive mobile-first design using SCSS (Sass) and React. Embracing the mobile-first approach, I prioritized the design and functionality for mobile devices, ensuring seamless user experiences across various screen sizes. Leveraging the power of SCSS, I organized and streamlined my stylesheets, making them more maintainable and scalable. By utilizing React components, I built a modular and reusable UI system, promoting efficiency and consistency throughout the project. Through meticulous design decisions and thoughtful implementation, I achieved a harmonious balance between aesthetics and usability, delivering an intuitive and visually appealing experience for users across all devices.
